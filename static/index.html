		"The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will
		be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars
		on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will
		hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth." - <i>Oscar Wilde</i>

	 "The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its
	 own shame." - <i>Oscar Wilde</i>
